My PhD research was about optimisation of recombinant protein production by utilising thermodynamics, statistical mechanics and several biophysical aspects of mRNA and proteins. Based on machine learning methods, I then developed several tools aimed to optimise each step in a recombinant protein expression experiment. I also did a full stack development of the websuite of these tools, [TISIGNER](https://tisigner.com). The LaTeX files for my PhD thesis can be found [here](https://github.com/bkb3/PhD-thesis).\n\n\nFor my M.Sc., I developed a mathematical model to describe the time evolution of gravitational waves at the very early universe (~380,000 years after the Big Bang). I then used the model was to predict effect of those waves, in particular the [B-mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background#B-modes), in the [cosmic microwave background radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background). The predictions agreed with the results form the famous [BICEP2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BICEP_and_Keck_Array#BICEP2) experiment.\n\nIf you've read this far, you may have noticed, I am interested in Mathematics, Physics, Biology and many other things.\nI also make scientific softwares, websites and mobile apps. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.\n\n# Currently\n\nI submitted my thesis for PhD recently (3 May 2021). I am currently working as an assistant research fellow.\n\n# Other interests\nMostly a super nerd lol. I find these things interesting (in no particular order):\n- GNU/Linux. Still wondering how SystemD took over everything, just _overnight_? (inb4 ebin tips le fedora meme). I would love to use SysVinit on my Arch again, but these days I don't care anymore. My laptop runs Debian Buster (with SystemD!) and my work computer uses Ubuntu (again with SystemD!).\n- Organisms, cellular complexity amazes me. RNA and proteins are next level stuffs, much complicated than I ever imagined.\n- Cellular automata, this is some magic.\n- Quantum computing, although I am not too hopeful that this will take off in my lifetime.\n- Universe and consciousness.\n",l=h.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,m=function(e){var t=Object.assign({},e);return Object(n.jsx)(a.b,Object(s.a)({},t))};t.default=function(){return Object(n.jsx)(c.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Bikash",children:Object(n.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(n.jsx)("header",{children:Object(n.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(n.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(n.jsx)(a.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(n.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",l," words)"]})]})}),Object(n.jsx)(r.a,{source:h,renderers:{Link:m},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
